# Chess-Engine

# This is a chess engine I have created from scratch in Python to better my programming skills.
# The code is quite bloated and likely hard to read, but my goal here is to see if I can do it! And to show off to recruiters I did.

# Main.py file is the driver file which calls Engine.py. Responsible for user input, drawing board/pieces, etc.
# Engine.py is where legal move logic is done, as well as reading in FEN notation and updating game state.
